title: "What is Slai?"
description: "Slai is the fastest way for developers to build machine learning applications that can be deployed on serverless infrastructure and shared with anyone in the world."
---

On Slai, a **machine learning app** is more than just the model -- it consists of pre and post-processing logic, datasets, Python requirements, in addition to the training code for the model itself.

<Note>
  We started Slai to help developers build and deploy machine learning
  applications on powerful cloud environments, without having to think about
  infrastructure.

## Slai's 3 core components

### Build in the Sandbox

The sandbox is a cloud-based IDE to build and manage your ML apps.

- Write pre and post-processing logic in the [handler](/sandbox/model-handler)
- Write and [run tests](/sandbox/testing) on your model
- [Connect datasets](/sandbox/datasets) from an [integration](/integrations/connecting-s3-buckets)
- [Version your work](/sandbox/model-versions) as you iterate

### Deploy and Monitor

Applications are hosted on our serverless backend, with automatic scaling built-in.

- [Deploy a model](/sandbox/deployments) to a serverless endpoint
- Monitor **inference time, traffic, and latency**
- Search through the **Deployment Logs**
- [Integrate the API](/api-reference/model) into your app

### Share

Share your application with friends and colleagues. Slai makes your work fully reproducible - your end-to-end applications can be shared with anyone to customize and fork.

- **Publish your app** and share it with your colleagues and friends
- **Fork a sandbox** to customize and iterate on any model shared with you
- **Pin your model as a template** for use in your organization
