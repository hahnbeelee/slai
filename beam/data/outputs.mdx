You may want to create temporary files or directories for your Beam tasks. Beam includes **Outputs** which let you create files or directories when your function is invoked.

You can add **Output** to the same file with your `Beam.App()` definition. 

<Tip>
Outputs are ideal for cases where you don't need to persist data between tasks. 

If you'd like to persist your data between tasks (meaning you can stop a Beam task, resume it, and your data will still exist), you should use a [Persistent Volume](/beam/data/persistent-volumes) instead.
</Tip>

For example, if you wanted to save images generated during a function call, you could define an output like this:

```python
app.Output.File(path="output.png", name="myimage")
```

You can also create directories, through the `Output.Dir()` method:

```python
app.Output.Dir(path="images", name="generated_images")
```

### Accessing Outputs

You can download files created during each function execution by logging into the dashboard, finding your deployment, and clicking on the latest task.
