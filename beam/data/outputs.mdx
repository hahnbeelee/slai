### Saving Files During Function Execution

You'll probably want a way of saving files while your functions run on Beam. Beam has a concept called **Outputs** which let you define paths to save files to.

You can add **Outputs** to the same file with your `Beam.App()` definition. 

For example, if we wanted to save images generated during a function call, we could define an output like this:

```python
app.Outputs.File(path="output.png", name="myimage")
```

You can also create directories, through the `Outputs.Dir()` method:

```python
app.Outputs.Dir(path="images", name="generated_images")
```

### Accessing Saved Files

You can download files created during each function execution by logging into the dashboard, finding your deployment, and clicking on the latest task.
