### Saving Files During Function Execution

You'll probably want a way of saving files while your functions run on Beam. Beam has a concept called **Outputs** which let you save files created during the execution of your functions.

In `app.py`, you can define paths to save files to. For example, if we wanted to save images created when our functions are run, we could create an output like this:

```python
app.Outputs.File(path="output.png", name="myimage")
```

We can also define directories:

```python
app.Outputs.Dir(path="images", name="generated_images")
```

You can download files created during each function execution by logging into the dashboard, finding your deployment, and clicking on the latest task.
