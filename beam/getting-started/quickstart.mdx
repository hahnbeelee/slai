### Overview

In this guide, you'll learn how to:

- Create an app with Beam
- Deploy your app to production
- View your logs in the dashboard
- Call the REST API

### Getting started

You'll need two things setup before you can complete this guide:

- [An account on Beam](http://getbeam.dev)
- [The Beam CLI installed](/beam/getting-started/install-beam)

## Create an app

Let's first create a Python file which will contain our Beam app definition. This is the environment you'll be developing against once you start the app.

<Info>
  You can name your files whatever you'd like - Beam tries to limit the changes
  you need to make to your existing code structure, so you can organize your
  projects however you prefer.
</Info>

```python app.py
import beam

app = beam.App(
    name="hello-world",
    cpu=1,
    memory="4Gi",
    python_version="python3.8",
    python_packages=[],
)
```

## Connect to the runtime

Now spin up the environment. In your shell, run:

```curl
beam start app.py
```

You can run your code on this remote environment. It will feel as though you're working locally, but all your code is actually being run on a container we've magically spun up for you.

## Write a hello world function

Create a new file. This is the function you'll be deploying on Beam.

```python run.py
def hello_world(**inputs):
    print("After deploying, you'll see these logs in the web dashboard ðŸ‘€")
    return {"response": inputs["text"]}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    text = "Testing 123"
    hello_world(text=text)
```

## Test locally

You can run your code locally, just like you would normally. Except that this code will run on the remote environment that you defined above.

```curl
python run.py
```

## Write a REST API Trigger

Your function can be deployed as a REST API or a webhook.

Add a REST API Trigger to `app.py`:

```python app.py
import beam

app = beam.App(
    name="hello-world",
    cpu=1,
    memory="4Gi",
    python_version="python3.8",
    python_packages=[],
)

app.Trigger.RestAPI(
    inputs={"text": beam.Types.String()},
    outputs={
        "response": beam.Types.String(),
    },
    handler="run.py:hello_world",
)
```

## Deploying to prod ðŸš€

Deploy your app by running:

```curl
beam deploy app.py
```

A browser window will open, showing you the deployment logs.

## Calling the API

Click the **Call API** button in the dashboard. This will generate a cURL request for you to invoke the API. Copy the code, and paste it into your shell. You should see your logs and metrics appear in the dashboard.

## What's next?

Now that you've created a function, deployed it to prod, and invoked the API, you can explore some of our more advanced use cases, such as [deploying an app on GPU](/beam/getting-started/stable-diffusion-gpu) or scheduling your tasks to run asyncronously using [webhooks](/beam/getting-started/running-a-web-scraper).
