title: "Pricing and Billing"
---
Beam is serverless, so you are only charged for the compute used, down to the second. If you don't run anything, you aren't charged. There's no charge to keep a REST API running indefinitely, for example.

### Pricing

- **CPU**: $0.10 / hour, per core
- **GPU**: $2.05 / hour, per GPU
- **Memory**: $0.0025 / hour, per GB

### Monitoring compute usage

You can view all the compute you've consumed for the monthly billing period in
the **Plans and Billing** section of the **Settings** page.
