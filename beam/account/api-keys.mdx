Your API keys can be found in the
[Slai dashboard](https://www.slai.io/settings/api-keys). 

If you don't have an
account yet, [you can create one here](https://slai.io/login).

When you first create your account, an API key will be automatically created for
you.

You can create a new set of keys by clicking **Create New Key.**
