### Deploying Webhooks

Webhooks are used for deploying functions that run asyncronously on Beam. You can add webhook triggers to the file with your Beam app definition.

Webhooks require only two fields:

* Inputs 
* Handler 

Since webhooks run asyncronously and only return a Task ID, the outputs field is not required.

```python
app.Trigger.Webhook(
    inputs={"prompt": beam.Types.String()},
    handler="run.py:my_async_function",
)
```

### Invoking Webhooks 

Calling a webhook will return a Task ID.

You can view the status of each invocation in the dashboard, by clicking on your deployment and navigating to the latest task.

If any files were generated during the execution of your task, you can download them by clicking on the task, and clicking **Download**.
