### Scheduling a task

Beam apps can be scheduled to run using the `Schedule` trigger.

Here's an example of what this might look like:

```python
app.Trigger.Schedule(
    when="every 5m",
    handler="run.py:send_text",
)
```

`Schedule` supports cron and string expressions. You can use [Crontab](https://crontab.guru) to help generate expressions.

### Cron Expression Cheatsheet

Beam supports standard cron expressions. Here are a few examples:

| Schedule                                                         | Syntax               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Every minute                                                     | `*/1 * * * *`        |
| Every day at mightnight                                          | `0 0 * * *`          |
| 10:15am, daily                                                   | `0 15 10 ? * *`      |
| 2:10 p.m. and at 2:44 p.m. every Wednesday in the month of March | `0 10,44 14 ? 3 WED` |

### String Expression Cheatsheet

You can also write expressions using a friendlier human-readable syntax, for intervals up to 1 hour.

| Schedule        | Syntax     |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Every 1 second  | `every 1s` |
| Every 5 minutes | `every 5m` |
| Every 3 hours   | `every 3h` |
