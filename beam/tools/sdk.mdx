### Installation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Setup Virtual Environment" icon={solid("circle-1")}>
		Set up a new folder wherever you want and create a virtual env:
		```curl
		python3 -m virtualenv .venv
		```
		Source virtual env: 
		```curl
		source .venv/bin/activate
		```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    title="Install Beam SDK"
    icon={solid("circle-2")}
  >
    Install Beam SDK
		```curl
		pip install beam-sdk
		```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Defining a runtime

Your Beam runtime is defined in Python. Running the code below will create an
environment with the compute defined above, build the image, and hot reload as
you work.

```python
beam.App(
	name="testapp",
	cpu=8,
	memory="4Gi",
	gpu=0,
	python_version="python3.8",
	python_packages=["numpy"],
)
```
