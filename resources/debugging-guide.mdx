This page contains instructions to debug common errors.

We try to make our product intuitive, but there are still cases where things get confusing or just don't work. This page is a guide to debug the rough edges that people sometimes experience when using the product.

  model into memory before making an invocation.
</Accordion>

## Installing dependencies

<Accordion title="ModuleNotFoundError">

  try to install dependencies in the dependencies section first.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="400 responses">

  receive a string field, it will return a 400 if you pass in a float.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="404 responses">
  This can happen when the `slai-cli` SDK is outdated. Run `pip install
  --upgrade slai-cli` to upgrade to the latest version.
