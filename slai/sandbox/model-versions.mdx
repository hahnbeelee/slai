## What's a revision?

Revisions in Slai are similar to branches in git. For each model, you can have several revisions, each with a unique name.

Each revision has its own sandbox, model handler, and model artifacts. When you're working on a particular model, you're always working on a specific revision of that model. The default starting revision is named _initial_. You can see and create revision from the drop-down next to the model name at the top of your sandbox:

It is important to note that each revision can only have **one deployment running** at any given time.

Why might you want to revision? Here are a few use cases to get you started:

- **A/B testing model performance**: Create a revision and train a variant of the original. Deploy each revision, divide traffic between the two models, and see how they perform against each other.
- **Collaborate with your team**: Signal what you're working on with a descriptive branch name. For example `ignore-outliers` or `broaden-dataset`
- **Creating a set of similar, but slightly different models**: You might start with a strong general image classifier like ImageNet and concurrently deploy several variations that make different tradeoffs.
