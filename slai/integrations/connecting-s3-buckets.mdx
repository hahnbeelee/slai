### Connecting an Integration

Integrations live at the root level of Slai, which makes them accessible from any sandbox in your account. To create an integration, click the **Integrations** tab on the sidebar [on your dashboard.](https://slai.io/models)

You'll be presented with a list of existing integrations, if any exist. Click **Add Integration** to create a new one.

You'll be prompted to enter a name, bucket name, AWS region, access key, and secret access key.

After selecting the integration, the data will be downloaded to the **Data Section** of the sandbox. You can use the data from your bucket like any ordinary folder or file.
