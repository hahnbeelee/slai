title: "Shipping Metrics Outside Slai"
description: "Shipping metrics to a third party tool is fairly straightforward. In this example, we'll log our training metrics to Weights and Biases (WandB) to track our experiments."

## Add your WandB API key to Slai

You can add your WandB API key to the [Slai Secrets Manager](/dashboard/secrets-management). If you don't yet have a WandB account, [you can signup for one here](/slai).

## Import the API key in the sandbox

You can access stored secrets in your sandbox through the `os.environ` object. We'll login to WandB with our API key:

```python
wandb.login(key=os.environ['SLAI_WANDB_API_KEY'])
```

## Logging metrics during training

To log metrics directly to WandB, you can add the following code to your training script. The `wandb.log()` method will record whatever data you wish to pass in during your training process.

```python
import wandb

wandb.login(key=os.environ['SLAI_WANDB']) # add your own API key

def train():
  for x in range(10):
    run = wandb.init(reinit=True)
    for y in range (100):
      wandb.log({"metric": x+y})
    run.finish()
```
