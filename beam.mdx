<Accordion title="What can you do with Beam?">
- Deploy ML models on serverless runtimes. Your app will scale automatically with traffic and spin down when idle.

- Develop on your local IDE, while running on remote GPUs

- Instantly jump from hacking on a script to serving an API in production

- Save money on your cloud bill. Beam is serverless and charges simple usage-based, per-second pricing

### ðŸ›° A local development experience on remote hardware

You can write and run your code locally - except when you enter your shell, your code will run on Beam instead of your local machine.

### ðŸ“¦ Setup remote virtual environments in code

Configure your runtime in Python - tell us how many GPUs you need and which libraries you want installed, and Beam will spawn a remote environment for you.

### ðŸš€ Deploy apps using Triggers

Beam includes triggers to schedule cron jobs, deploy webhooks, and send Slack alerts - all in just three lines of Python.

### Core Concepts

<Frame>

- **Apps**. Each project in Beam is called an app. When you first start Beam, you'll be prompted to define your environment through the `Beam.App()` method in the SDK.

- **Triggers**. Triggers are actions that can invoke your Beam apps. For example, a REST API trigger allows your Beam app to be invoked via a REST API. A webhook trigger will allow your Beam app to be invoked asyncronously using a webhook, and so on.

- **Outputs**. Outputs are file paths that can be used to save files created when your functions are run.
