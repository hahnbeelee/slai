### Why use Beam?

- You hate reading AWS / GCP documentation

- Your M1 laptop can't handle heavy computation, like training a transformer model

- You're building an ML model and want it deployed as an API to see how it performs in the real world

- You've tried using Lambda / Cloud Run and hate having to configure Docker files

- You've tried using FastAPI + a web server and hate writing glue code

### Beam is like AWS Lambda, optimized for data projects

- Develop in your local IDE while running on remote hardware

- Configure your runtime in Python. You can specify as many GPU/CPUs as you want.

- Scale from experimenting to serving in production

- Hot reloads. Make a change locally and instantly get a production endpoint.

- Connect your data warehouse directly to your virtual environment

- No Docker file management

- Add triggers for scheduled cron jobs, webhooks, and Slack alerts - in one line of Python.

- Usage-based, per-second pricing

### Core Concepts

- **Apps** - each project in Beam is called an app. When you first start Beam, you'll be prompted to define your environment through the `Beam.App()` method in the SDK.

- **Triggers** - triggers are actions that can invoke your Beam apps. For example, a REST API trigger allows your Beam app to be invoked via a REST API. A webhook trigger will allow your Beam app to be invoked asyncronously using a webhook, and so on.

- **Outputs** - outputs are file paths that can be used to save files created when your functions are run.
