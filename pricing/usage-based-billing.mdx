title: "Usage-Based Billing"
---

Slai charges for only the compute you actually use, and is billed by the second. Your total cost is based on a combination of CPU and Memory used, and will vary based on whether you're using a CPU or GPU.

<Card title="Cost for CPU Machines" icon={duotone("server")}>

**$0.06 / hour per CPU, or $0.015 / hour per GB memory - _whichever is greater_**

For example, a job using 4 CPU cores and 8GB of memory would cost $0.24 / hour. If the job takes 5 minutes to run, you'd pay $0.02.

**$0.10 / hour per GPU, or $0.025 / hour per GB memory - _whichever is
greater_**

## Monitoring compute usage

You can view all the compute you've consumed for the monthly billing period in the **Plans and Billing** section of the **Settings** page.

Tracking usage in the Billing panel

You'll see a table broken down by session type:

| Session Type | What it means                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Inference    | Total hours used for inference, or calling the API on a deployment |
| Job          | Total hours used for scheduled training jobs                       |
| Sandbox      | Total hours used for running code in the sandbox                   |

You can view a granular breakdown of the usage by clicking on a row in the table.
