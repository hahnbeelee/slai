title: "Usage-Based Billing"
---
Slai is serverless, so you are only charged for the compute used, down to the second. If you don't run anything, you aren't charged. There's no charge to keep a REST API running indefinitely, for example.

### Pricing

- **CPU**: $0.10 / hour, per core
- **GPU**: $2.05 / hour, per GPU
- **Memory**: $0.0025 / hour, per GB

## Monitoring compute usage

You can view all the compute you've consumed for the monthly billing period in the **Plans and Billing** section of the **Settings** page.

Tracking usage in the Billing panel

You'll see a table broken down by session type:

| Session Type | What it means                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Inference    | Total hours used for inference, or calling the API on a deployment |
| Job          | Total hours used for scheduled training jobs                       |
| Sandbox      | Total hours used for running code in the sandbox                   |

You can view a granular breakdown of the usage by clicking on a row in the table.
