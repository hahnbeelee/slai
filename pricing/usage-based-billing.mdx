title: "Usage-Based Billing"
---

Slai charges based on the actual compute usage, and is billed by the second of usage.  Your cost is based on the combination of CPU and Memory used, and will vary based on whether you're using a CPU or GPU. 

## Cost for CPU Machines

**$0.06 / hour per CPU, or $0.015 / hour per GB memory - whichever is greater**

For example, a job using 4 CPU cores and 8GB of memory would cost $0.24 / hour. If the job takes 5 minutes to run, you'd pay $0.02. 

## Cost for GPU Machines

**$0.10 / hour per CPU, or $0.025 / hour per GB memory - whichever is greater**

## Monitoring compute usage

You can view all the compute you've consumed for the monthly billing period in the **Plans and Billing** section of the **Settings** page.

Tracking usage in the Billing panel

You'll see a table broken down by session type:

| Session Type | What it means                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Inference    | Total hours used for inference, or calling the API on a deployment |
| Job          | Total hours used for scheduled training jobs                       |
| Sandbox      | Total hours used for running code in the sandbox                   |

You can view a granular breakdown of the usage by clicking on a row in the table.
