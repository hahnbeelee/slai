<Card title="Want us to help migrate your models?" icon={duotone("link")} href="https://calendly.com/elimernit/60min">
  You can book a 60 min call with our engineering team, and we'll get your models running by the end of the call.

Porting a model generally takes 10-20 minutes of refactoring. At a high level, the steps are:

1. Create an empty sandbox
2. [Install Python Requirements](/sandbox/dependencies)
3. (_Optional_) Upload pre-trained weights to the [data folder](/sandbox/datasets) (if you want to avoiding connecting your dataset and retraining the model from scratch)
4. Copy the model's code into the sandbox, returning your model class from the [`train.py` function](/sandbox/train)
5. Train the model
6. Create your [model handler](/sandbox/model-handler)
7. [Package and deploy](/sandbox/deployments)
