One of our core beliefs is around consistency - this means that we define a method that serves as a common entry point for training your model: `train()`, in `train.py`. This method must return a valid model artifact for our system to detect what framework you're using.

Porting a model generally takes just a few minutes of refactoring. At a high level, the steps are:

1. Create an empty sandbox
2. Install python requirements
3. (Optional) Upload pre-trained weights to the data folder (if you want to avoiding connecting your dataset and retraining the model from scratch)
4. Copy the model's code into the sandbox, returning your model class from the `train.py` function
5. Train the model
6. Create your model handler (see: [Handler](/sandbox/model-handler))
7. Package and deploy

**An example: Basic scikit-learn model**
