You can configure the machine for your model deployment by clicking **Advanced deployment options** in the deployment modal.

You may wish to do things like:

- Deploy your model on a GPU

- Keep your model warm to eliminate the serverless cold start

- Configure the CPU and Memory available on your deployment

- Configure how long to wait before scaling your deployment down to zero after the last request
