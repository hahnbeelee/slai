You may wish to use Slai for packaging and deployment, while doing your training elsewhere. Let's walk through a quick tutorial on how you can use pre-trained models in your Slai project.

In this example, we'll use a pre-trained GPT-2 model from HuggingFace.

**Let's start with `train.py`**. Simply import your pre-trained model in `train.py` and return the model class in `train()`

```python train.py
import transformers import pipeline, set_seet

def train():
  mode = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt-2")
  set_seed(42)

  return model
```

**Now, let's move onto `handler.py`**. In your handler, you can define how you'd like to handle the inputs and outputs to the pre-trained model. In this example, we'll pass a string input, and return a JSON object with generated sentences from GPT-2.

```python handler.py
import slai

class ModelHandler(slai.BaseModelHander):
  inputs = {"text": slai.types.String()}

  outputs = {
    "prediction": slai.types.Json(),
  }

  def call(self, artifact, **inputs):
    gpt2 = artifact
    prediction = gpt2(inputs["text"], max_length=500, num_return_sequences=5)
    return {"prediction": prediction}
```

Even though the model is trained, you'll need to click `Train` to download the pre-trained weights into the sandbox. Once that is complete, you can test the model before deploying.

In the test panel, you'll get an interactive test utility to send requests to the model. Let's generate some sentences!
